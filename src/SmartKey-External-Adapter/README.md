# SmartKey Device External Adapter

This external adapter allows interaction with with [SmartKey devices](https://github.com/mseminatore/teslamock) for testing purposes

See [Tesla API](https://www.teslaapi.io/) for a community built Tesla API specification, including how to obtain a valid authentication token, as well as a valid vehicle ID.

This adapter was built as part of the [Link My Ride](https://github.com/pappas999/Link-My-Ride) submission to the Chainlink 2020 Virtual Hackathon, and currently supports the following API calls:
- Vehicle Authentication
- Vehicle Unlock
- Vehicle Lock
- Vehicle Honk Horn
- Vehicle obtain odometer, charge level & location data


## Prerequisites and installation

This implementation stores users' Tesla API tokens in a [Google Firestore](https://cloud.google.com/firestore) database. This is because it needs to support multiple vehicles.

[Guide for setting up Firestore in Google Cloud](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart)

If only 1 vehicle is to be used, you can modify the adapter to store it in an environment variable

Here are the required environment variables for this external adapter:

## Environment variables

| Variable      |               | Description | Example |
|---------------|:-------------:|------------- |:---------:|
| `FIRESTORE_PROJECT_ID`     | **Required**  | The Project ID that contains your Google Cloud Firestore serverless DB | `tesla-firestore-db` |
| `FIRESTORE_COLLECTION_NAME`  | **Required**  | The collection name of your Google Cloud Firestore serverless DB | `telsa-api-tokens` |
| `BASE_URL`  | **Optional**  | The URL of the Tesla API. If left null will default to the Tesla Production Servers | `https://owner-api.teslamotors.com/` |

See [Install Locally](#install-locally) for a quickstart

## Input Params

The structure for the JSON input is as follows. In this example jobSpec is 534ea675a9524e8e834585b00368b178. Actions may be any of the following:
- authenticate
- wake_up
- vehicle_data
- unlock
- lock
- honk_horn

```json
{ 
    "id": "534ea675a9524e8e834585b00368b178",
    "data": { 
    	"apiToken": "abcdefghi",
    	"vehicleId": "23423423423423423423",
        "action": "authenticate",
        "address": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000" // (only required for 'authenticate' action) The address corresponding to the vehicle to be verified
    }
}
```

## Output
If the action was unlock or lock, the data output json contains the following values:
- (odometer, chargeLevel, longitude to 6dp, latitude to 6dp)

If the action was authenticate, the result output responds with the wallet address representing the vehicle that was just authenticated
```json
{
    "jobRunID": 0,
    "data": "{50000,55,-35008518,138575206}",
    "result": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
    "statusCode": 200
}
```

## Live Demo
We have a version of the adapter currently running on Google Cloud at the following location. It is currently pointing to a mock Tesla server

[https://australia-southeast1-link-my-ride.cloudfunctions.net/Tesla-External-Adapter](https://australia-southeast1-link-my-ride.cloudfunctions.net/Tesla-External-Adapter)


## Install Locally

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Test

To run the Jest unit tests (which mock Axios and Firestore):

```bash
npm test
```

Natively run the application (defaults to port 8080):

### Run

```bash
npm start
```

## Call the external adapter/API server

```bash
curl -X POST -H "content-type:application/json" "http://localhost:8080/" --data '{ "id": 534ea675a9524e8e834585b00368b178, "data": { "apiToken": "abcdefghi", "vehicleId": "23423423423423423423", "action": "authenticate" } }'
```
## Docker

If you wish to use Docker to run the adapter, you can build the image by running the following command:

```bash
docker build . -t tesla-external-adapter
```

Then run it with:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 -it tesla-external-adapter:latest
```

## Serverless hosts

After [installing locally](#install-locally):

### Create the zip

```bash
zip -r tesla-external-adapter.zip .
```

### Install to AWS Lambda

- In Lambda Functions, create function
- On the Create function page:
  - Give the function a name
  - Use Node.js 12.x for the runtime
  - Choose an existing role or create a new one
  - Click Create Function
- Under Function code, select "Upload a .zip file" from the Code entry type drop-down
- Click Upload and select the `tesla-external-adapter.zip` file
- Handler:
    - index.handler for REST API Gateways
    - index.handlerv2 for HTTP API Gateways
- Add all environment variables mentioned further above
- Save

#### To Set Up an API Gateway (HTTP API)

If using a HTTP API Gateway, Lambda's built-in Test will fail, but you will be able to externally call the function successfully.

- Click Add Trigger
- Select API Gateway in Trigger configuration
- Under API, click Create an API
- Choose HTTP API
- Select the security for the API
- Click Add

#### To Set Up an API Gateway (REST API)

If using a REST API Gateway, you will need to disable the Lambda proxy integration for Lambda-based adapter to function.

- Click Add Trigger
- Select API Gateway in Trigger configuration
- Under API, click Create an API
- Choose REST API
- Select the security for the API
- Click Add
- Click the API Gateway trigger
- Click the name of the trigger (this is a link, a new window opens)
- Click Integration Request
- Uncheck Use Lamba Proxy integration
- Click OK on the two dialogs
- Return to your function
- Remove the API Gateway and Save
- Click Add Trigger and use the same API Gateway
- Select the deployment stage and security
- Click Add

### Install to GCP

- In Functions, create a new function, choose to ZIP upload
- Click Browse and select the `tesla-external-adapter.zip` file
- Select a Storage Bucket to keep the zip in
- Function to execute: gcpservice
- Click More, Add variable. Add all environment variables mentioned further above
